# Maintenance calendar

This is the single freshness schedule for Deshi Startup: what to re-check, where and how often.
A `verified:` date changes only after the relevant claims are re-checked, not after a routine edit.

## Annual

| Action | Sources | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Mine the national budget speech (delivered every June) for startup-relevant tax/VAT changes; update the regulatory changelog page and any fee tables it touches. | Finance Act, NBR circulars, budget speech | High |
| Sweep all license/registration fee tables site-wide for the new fiscal year and year-stamp every number found ("২০২৭ সালের হিসাবে…"). | RJSC, NBR, city corporation portals, Invest Bangladesh | High |
| Re-read the consolidated foreign-exchange circulars on export and import transactions, reissued every July with one year's validity, and update the retention-quota rates, thresholds and repatriation deadlines they carry (`/growth/cross-border-rules`, `/trade/*`, `/funding/fdi-rules`). Amending circulars land mid-year, so treat the July consolidation as the floor, not the only check. | Bangladesh Bank FEPD-1 circulars | High |

## Monthly

| Action | Sources | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Track RJSC/NBR fee notices, SROs, circulars, and portal process changes; update affected pages directly rather than waiting for the annual sweep. | RJSC, NBR, VAT Online | High |
| Run the media dry-run and compare the committed registry with the live R2 object count/bytes; prune grace-expired retired objects and investigate any non-zero billable usage or unexplained Class B spike. | `plan/media-operations.md`, R2 metrics, Billable Usage | High |
| Refresh the opportunity/event calendar: demo days, grant application windows, accelerator cohort deadlines, pitch nights. | iDEA, BIG, Startup Bangladesh, BASIS, universities | Medium |

## Quarterly

| Action | Sources | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Re-verify every directory entry (`data/directory/*.json`): confirm the organization is still active, refresh `lastVerified`, fix dead links. | Official sites, LinkedIn, public profiles | High |
| Reach out to university E-cells for founder interview leads and distribution; treat them as both a source and a channel. | BRAC, NSU, DU, IBA and other E-cells | Medium |

## Ongoing (no fixed cadence, but never skip before publishing)

| Action | Sources | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Re-check legal/compliance pages against official sources before publishing or bumping `verified:`; have 1-2 practicing CAs/lawyers review where possible. | RJSC, NBR, VAT Online, Bangladesh Bank, Invest Bangladesh, city corporations | High |
| Prioritize founder interviews for practical patterns: early wedge, trust-building tactics, and mistakes — this is what generic advice misses. | Future Startup, YouTube, podcasts, LinkedIn | High |
| Translate the insight, not the words, from English-language reports into practical Bangla guidance, with attribution (adapt, don't translate — see AGENTS.md style guide). | LightCastle, UNESCAP, World Bank, DataReportal | Medium |
| Evaluate public Bangla blogs, Facebook posts, videos, and legal explainers for source leads (not for copying). | Prothom Alo, LawDoors, Justice Corner, public groups | Medium |
| Summarize and synthesize third-party publications; never scrape or reproduce long passages. | All third-party publications | High (always) |

## How to use this calendar

- This file tells you *when* to re-check something; `plan/sources.csv` tells you *where*; the
  `verified:` frontmatter field (see AGENTS.md) records *that* it was actually re-checked.
- Treat missed cadences as backlog: if a quarterly directory re-verification is overdue, it's a
  higher-priority task than most unwritten stubs.
- When a check surfaces a real change (a fee moved, a portal URL changed, a program shut down),
  fix the content in the same pass — don't just note it here.
